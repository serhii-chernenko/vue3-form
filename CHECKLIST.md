- The data is ONLY updated in the parent when the form is submitted
- The communication between the `LoginForm` and `App.vue` is ONLY be via the v-model directive and does NOT use any custom named events
- When the data is updated in the parent it flows down through the v-model and immediately updates the value of the username/password fields in the form
